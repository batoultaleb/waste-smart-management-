# waste-smart-management-
Java project that stimulate smart public waste bin tracking using multiple data structures 
# Smart Waste Bin Management System

This Java project simulates a smart waste management system. It allows city authorities to track public waste bins, monitor their fill levels, and efficiently decide which bins need to be emptied first.

## Features
- Add and track waste bins
- Monitor bin fill levels
- Prioritize collection using PriorityQueue
- Maintain bin information using HashMap
- Track actions and support undo with Stack
- Maintain order of operations using LinkedList

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Eclipse IDE
- Data Structures: HashMap, PriorityQueue, LinkedList, Stack

## Project Purpose
This application was developed as a university project to apply Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures in solving a real-life problem: optimizing public waste collection.

## How to Run
- Open the project in Eclipse
- Compile and run the main class
- Follow the on-screen instructions from the menu
